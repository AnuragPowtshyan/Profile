            <h2 class="glow-text">Amazon Sales Dashboard</h2>
            <p>For my Amazon Sales project, I created an interactive dashboard using Power BI that provides insights into key sales metrics. The dashboard visualizes data on product performance, sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management. With easy-to-read charts and graphs, users can track sales growth, identify top-selling products, and monitor overall performance in real-time. This project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights for business decision-making.</p>

            <h2 class="glow-text">HealthCare Dashboard</h2>
            <p>For my Healthcare project, I developed a comprehensive dashboard for a hospital using Power BI to track key health metrics and operational data. The dashboard visualizes patient admissions, treatment outcomes, staff performance, and resource utilization, providing hospital administrators with actionable insights. By organizing complex data into easy-to-read charts and graphs, the dashboard aids in efficient decision-making and improves hospital management and patient care delivery.</p>

            <p>For my Ola Sales project, I designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track sales performance and operational metrics for Ola. The dashboard highlights key data points such as daily ride volume, revenue, driver performance, and customer satisfaction. By providing real-time insights into sales trends and operational efficiency, it enables stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize routes, and improve customer service to boost overall sales performance.</p>
