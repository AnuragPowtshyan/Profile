With a strong analytical mindset, I specialize in <strong>data visualization</strong> and <strong>automation</strong>, helping businesses extract meaningful insights. My passion for technology drives me to explore new frameworks and stay ahead in the ever-evolving digital landscape. When I‚Äôm not coding, I love <strong>traveling</strong>, <strong>listening to music</strong>, and <strong>playing cricket</strong>.

            <p class="fade-in">From a young age, I was fascinated by how technology shapes the world.

            <p class="fade-in">When I‚Äôm not working on projects, I immerse myself in exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and meeting new people. Traveling broadens my perspective and inspires me to think beyond boundaries, much like how technology connects people across the globe.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">Music is another integral part of my life. Whether I‚Äôm coding or unwinding after a long day, music serves as a source of motivation and creativity.
